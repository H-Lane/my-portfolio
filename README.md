# my-portfolio
Week 2 Challenge - Create the beginnings of my web portfolio


## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a basic portfolio follwing a set of specific criteria. I created this project to get the experience in making my first functioning website from scratch as well as getting an understanding of my particular coding style. This project has made me better understand my limitations and the areas I need to improve my knowledge of. Through this project I have learned various CSS tricks such as creating translucent blurred elements, splitting a page so that only half of it scrolls, and animated scrolling text. I have also gained considerable comfortability with basic elements and CSS syntax.
